## This lab uses the same two datasets we used in class ("Media_nodes.csv" and "Media_edges.csv")
## Import the datsets and convert them into a network object using igraph 

```{r, eval=false}


```

## Compute each node's outdegree centrality scores 

```{r, eval=false}


```

## Visualize the network with the node size proportional to outdegree scores 
```{r, eval=false}


```

## Display the nodes' media types (tv, newspaper, etc) 
## rather than their organization's names (NY Times, ABC, etc)

```{r, eval=false}


```
